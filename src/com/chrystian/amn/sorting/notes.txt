Merge 2 sorted arrays algorithm

As a reference, I have been using the second approach which has O(n1+n2) time and O(n1+n2) space

AVL tree is a self-balanced binary tree.
Its self-balancing feature lie in ROTATION!!!!!

some key description on AVL tree rotation:
3 important element here:
    -root: the node with the first occurrence of imbalance from the bottom (leaf)
    -pivot:  the child (left or right) with larger depth
    -parent: the parent of root
Rotation Algorithm
adjust()
if parent doesn't exist, add root to pivot's child (side depends on value),
    if pivot has child node on that side, and that child node to root.
if parent exists, add pivot as parent's correpoing child, then do the same as previous
finally, if parent exist, run the entire adjust again.ÃŸ
