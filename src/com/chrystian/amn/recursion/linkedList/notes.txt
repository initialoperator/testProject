https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

The ListNode method has been accepted.



the mergeKLists method is for
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/description/
Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.

Example:

Input:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

according to this article,
https://leetcode.com/articles/merge-k-sorted-list/
you can use a divide-and-conquer method (approach 5)
I will try it

心得：凡事看到array关于sorting或者merging的问题，首先可以想能不能用divide and conquer. D&C的方法暗示了时间是LogN
