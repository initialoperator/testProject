Merge 2 sorted arrays algorithm
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-two-sorted-arrays/
As a reference, I have been using the second approach which has O(n1+n2) time and O(n1+n2) space

*AVL tree is a self-balanced binary tree.
Its self-balancing feature lie in ROTATION!!!!!

some key description on AVL tree rotation:
3 important element here:
    -root: the node with the first occurrence of imbalance from the bottom (leaf)
    -pivot:  the child (left or right) with larger depth
    -parent: the parent of root
Rotation Algorithm
adjust()
if parent doesn't exist, add root to pivot's child (side depends on value),
    if pivot has child node on that side, and that child node to root.
if parent exists, add pivot as parent's correpoing child, then do the same as previous
finally, if parent exist, run the entire adjust again.


*Heap
Heap is a tree structure that puts smaller value (or larger value at the top), the upper level element is guaranteed to be smaller than lower level.
this page explains Heap insertion algorithem
http://www.algolist.net/Data_structures/Binary_heap/Insertion
-first find a "slot" to insert to the bottom (如果没有slot呢？)
-adjust the new node's level by swapping with parent until a right level.

For heap insertion, we need to check its completeness, not the height difference.
Doing height is a bit more difficult to go recursive.

！！A smarter one to to node swap: only swap the value but not need for the actual node object

这个答案陈述了为什么heap insert average time complexity is O(1)

Summary

          Type      BST (*)   Heap
Insert    average   log(n)    1
Insert    worst     log(n)    log(n)
Find any  worst     log(n)    n
Find max  worst     1 (**)    1
Create    worst     n log(n)  n
*: everywhere in this answer, BST == Balanced BST, since unbalanced sucks asymptotically
**: using a trivial modification explained in this answer
